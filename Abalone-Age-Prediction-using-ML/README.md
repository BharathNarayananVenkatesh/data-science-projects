# Abalone Age Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **age of abalone (a marine mollusk)** using easily measurable physical features such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, and shell weight. Traditionally, abalone age is determined by cutting the shell and counting rings under a microscope, which is costly and time-consuming. This project explores a **data-driven alternative** using machine learning models.
