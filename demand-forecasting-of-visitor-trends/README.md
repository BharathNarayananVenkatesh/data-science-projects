# ðŸŒ² Yellowstone Visitor Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

This project uses **Trend Models** (Linear, Quadratic, Cosine, Seasonal Dummy) and **SARIMA** to forecast monthly visitors to **Yellowstone National Park**.  
It demonstrates end-to-end **time series analysis** â€” from data cleaning, decomposition, model selection (AIC/BIC), to 10-month forecasting.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **data/** â€“ Raw dataset (or a link to National Park Service IRMA data portal)
- **notebooks/** â€“ RMarkdown file with complete analysis and plots
- **scripts/** â€“ Clean R script for reproducibility
- **results/** â€“ Saved figures, forecasts, model selection metrics
- **BHEMAN_Report.pdf** â€“ Full project report

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **R**: `forecast`, `TSA`, `FitAR`, `ggplot2`, `tseries`, `lmtest`
- **Models**: Trend Models, Seasonal Dummy Regression, SARIMA
- **Metrics**: AIC, BIC, RMSE, MAE, Ljung-Box test, Shapiro-Wilk test

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- **Seasonal Dummy Regression** explained **93.5% of variance**, best for deterministic seasonal pattern.
- **SARIMA(1,1,2)Ã—(1,1,1)12** chosen as final stochastic model â€” lowest AIC/BIC, best residual diagnostics.
- Forecast shows:
  - **Sharp summer peak** (July ~939k visitors)
  - **Very low winter months**
  - Clear seasonality and gradual year-on-year growth
