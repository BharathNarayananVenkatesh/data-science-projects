# Movie Recommender System

This project develops a **movie recommendation system** as part of my Master's in Data Science coursework.  
The system applies collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to suggest movies to users.

## Files
- **assignment3.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **A3Slides.pdf** → Summary of methodology and results.
- **A3Presentation.mp4** → Recorded video presentation.
- **requirements.txt** → Python dependencies.

## Key Features
- Implemented **Collaborative Filtering** using cosine similarity and matrix factorization (SVD).
- Applied **Content-Based Filtering** with Nearest Neighbors.
- Evaluated models using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
- Used sparse matrix representations for efficiency.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, SciPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook assignment3.ipynb
