# Data Sampling and Predictive Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, starting from **data preparation** to **statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering**.  
The work covers multiple analytical techniques, including **linear regression, classification, and unsupervised learning**, to extract insights from sampled data.  

Originally developed as part of my Master's in Data Science, the project has been refactored and structured as a professional portfolio piece.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Loaded and cleaned dataset  
   - Handled missing values and standardized features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized distributions and relationships using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
   - Conducted statistical tests for deeper insights  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Applied **Linear Regression** to analyze variable relationships  
   - Built and evaluated a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier**  

4. **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**  
   - Applied **KMeans clustering**  
   - Evaluated clusters with **silhouette score**  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion matrix for detailed performance insights
